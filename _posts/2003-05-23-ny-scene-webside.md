Ny scene webside som virker veldig bra :-) Har mange nyttige lenker.
ModArchive.com skrev dette om websiden: Attention all scene members!
Whether you're in the demo scene, the tracking scene, or the gaming
scene, take note: there is a brand new scene site on the web. The Scene
Rep site (http://www.scenerep.32k.org) has now gone live! Goals include
encouraging further development in the scene as well as providing a wide
variety of scene resources. There are several features on the site,
including the growing collection of scene resources, some information
about the scene, and our feature section: it's the Scene-Zine, a monthly
'Zine dedicated to the scene. It's all about support and exposure, and
we're always on the lookout for scene-related stories. So take a moment
to check out the Scene Rep! - http://www.scenerep.32k.org
